    long_description='''Manipulating data loaded from json is very error prone.

If the format changes unexpectedly, errors arise at the time of use, fields can
disappear or change type.

This library allows loading data using NamedTuple and similar type hints,
to obtain a more safe to use data structure. All exceptions will be generated in
a single point, when loading, rather than in multiple points, when using.

It also provides a module to do the opposite and revert back to something that
can be converted to json.
