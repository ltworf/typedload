Comparisons
===========

In this section we compare typedload to other similar libraries.

In general, the advantages of typedload over competing libraries are:

* Works with existing codebase and uses standard types. No inheritance or decorators
* Easy to extend, even with objects from 3rd party libraries
* Stable API, breaking changes only happen on major releases (it has happened once since 2018)
* Supports Union properly
* Works on python 3.5
* Mypy and similar work without plugins
* Can use and convert camelCase and snake_case
* Functional approach
* Pure Python, no compiling

### It works with existing codebase

Most libraries require your classes to extend or use decorators from the library itself.

This means that types from other libraries or non supported stdlib classes can never be used.

It also means that mypy will just work out of the box, rather than requiring plugins.

Instead, typedload works fine with the type annotations from the `typing` module and will work without requiring any changes to the datatypes.

It also works on python 3.5, so projects running on LTS distributions can use it.

### It is easy to extend

Since there can be situations that are highly domain specific, typedload allows to extend its functionality to support more types or replace the existing code to handle special cases.

### Support of Union

Other libraries tend to either be very slow or just give completely wrong results when Union are involved.

# Functional approach

You can load a `List[YourType]`, while pydantic can only load a single object that then will contain the list.


apischema
---------

Found [here](https://github.com/wyfo/apischema)

It's the only viable alternative to typedload that I've encountered.

* It reuses the same objects in the output, so changing the data might result in subtle bugs if the input data is used again
* Doesn't support as many python versions as typedload (currently no 3.11 and no 3.5)
* No native support for attrs


pydantic
--------

Found [here](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/)

* [They change API all the time, between minor releases.](https://pypi.org/project/pydantic/1.9.1/)
* Slower than typedload
* Requires all the classes to derive from a superclass
* Does not work with mypy:
    * [Abuses python typing annotation to mean something different, breaking linters](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/models/#required-optional-fields)
    * [Uses float=None without using Optional in its own documentation](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/models/#recursive-models).
* Union might do casting when casting is not needed.

jsons
-----

Found [here](https://github.com/ramonhagenaars/jsons)

* It is buggy:
    * This returns an int `jsons.load(1.1, Union[int, float])`
    * This raises an exception `jsons.load(1.0, int | float)`
* [Does not support `Literal`](https://github.com/ramonhagenaars/jsons/issues/170)
* Can't load iterables as lists
* Exceptions do not have information to find the incorrect data
* It is incredibly slow:

```python
# Needed because jsons can't load directly from range()
data = [i for i in range(3000000)]

# This took 2.5s with jsons and 200ms with typedload
load(data, list[int])

# This took 20s with jsons and 500ms with typedload
load(data, list[Union[float,int]])
```

dataclasses-json
----------------

Found [here](https://github.com/lidatong/dataclasses-json)

* 20x slower than typedload
* Does not check types
* Requires to decorate all the classes
* It is not extensible
* Doesn't support Union (and other types)
* Has dependencies (marshmallow, marshmallow-enum, typing-inspect)
* Very complicated way for doing lists
