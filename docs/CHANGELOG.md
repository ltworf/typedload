2.28
====

2.27
====
* Add support for re.Patterns

2.26
====
* Update type hints file

2.25
====
* Improve performance for loading objects (attrs/dataclasses/NamedTuple)

* Switch performance tests to test against pydantic2

2.24
====
* Drop support to Python 3.7 (which has reached EOL)

  It makes the normal case slightly slower, and gives massive performance
  improvements when exceptions are raised.

2.23
====
* When loading a string into datetime.date/time/datetime, ISO 8601 is used
* When dumping, setting `isodates=True` dumps an ISO 8601 string instead of a list of ints. The previous behaviour is now deprecated.
* Add support for datetime.timedelta. It is dumped as a float representing seconds
* Deprecate dump handlers without type hints
* Improve performance for dumping, by carrying type hints
* Remove `jsons` and `dataclasses-json` from benchmarks.
  They were too slow to be a useful comparison.

====
* Improve loading time for literals
* Support attrs converter

2.21
====
* Drop support to Python 3.5 and 3.6
* Improve performance for dumping

* Document performance testing
* Improve performances when loading iterables
* Greatly improve performances when loading `Union` of objects that are `Literal` annotated

2.16
====
* Add is_optional function
* Support new style union (A | B)
* Experimental support for PEP563 `__future__.annotations`.
  **READ ABOUT DEFERRED EVALUATION IN THE DOCUMENTATION.**

2.14
====
* Fix bug where AttributeError from name mangling caused an AssertionError

2.13
====

* Allow duck typing when loading attr (allow any dict-like class to be used)
* Minor performance improvements

2.12
====
* Add `uniondebugconflict` flag to detect unions with conflicts.

2.11
====
* Make newer mypy happy

2.10
====
* Fix setup.py referring to a non-existing file when installing with pip

===
* Better type sorting in `Union`
  This helps when using `Union[dataclass, str]`

2.2
===
* Add Python3.9 to the supported versions

  type.

* Fix bug in loading attr classes and passing random crap.
  Now the proper exception is raised.
