typedload
=========

This library loads Python data structures into
typed data structures, enforcing a schema.

The main purpose is to load things that come from
json, bson or similar into NamedTuple or Dataclass.

For example this Json:
   {
       'users': [
           {
               'username': 'salvo',
               'shell': 'bash',
               'sessions': ['pts/4', 'tty7', 'pts/6']
           },
           {
               'username': 'lop'
           }
       ],
   }

Can be treated more easily if loaded into this:

class User(NamedTuple):
   username: str
   shell: str = 'bash'
   sessions: List[str] = []

class Logins(NamedTuple):
   users: List[User]

And can then be loaded with

typedload.load(data, Logins)

Simple API
==========

typedload.load() and typedload.dump() are functions to quickly load and dump
data using the default objects.

They create a new loader/dumper object with default parameters, and
discard it after.

Classes
=======

The loader and dumper classes expose a number of attributes that can be
customised to tweak their behaviour.

Supported datatypes
===================

There is support for:
    * Basic python types (int, str, bool, float, NoneType)
    * NamedTuple
    * Enum
    * Optional[SomeType]
    * List[SomeType]
    * Dict[TypeA, TypeB]
    * Tuple[TypeA, TypeB, TypeC]
    * Tuple[SomeType, ...]
    * Set[SomeType]
    * Union[TypeA, TypeB]
    * ForwardRef
    * Literal
    * Dataclass
    * attrs
    * TypedDict
    * datetime
    * Path
    * IPv4Address, IPv6Address

Handlers
========

To work with other datatypes, handlers can be used.

The handlers' list items are tuples for two functions. The signatures are
different for loader or dumper.

The first function returns a boolean, and if the value is true, the object
will call the second function and return its result.

Basically a loader and a dumper class have no functionality (but come with
a default list of handlers).

So, to add support for a new type, it is sufficient to write a function that
outputs the desired value, and a function that decides when to call that.

The index() function returns the position of handlers in the list, so that
it is possible to remove them or add new handlers before or after a given
handler.

The pointer to the loader or dumper object is passed, so that the attributes
in use for that particular object are available.

For example, if we want to add a special loader that when loading the int 42
into a string returns 'quarantadue', we can do this:

from typedload.dataloader import Loader
l = Loader()
l.handlers.insert(
    l.index(str), # This will place this entry before the string handler
    (
        lambda x: x == str,
        lambda loader, value, type_: str(value) if value != 42 else 'quarantadue'
    )
)

Then this will happen:

In [15]: l.load(12, str)
Out[15]: '12'

In [16]: l.load(42, str)
Out[16]: 'quarantadue'

This can of course be used also for use cases that make sense.

The handlers must generate exceptions from the typedload.exceptions
module.

Due to internal cache, it is not supported to modify the list of the
handlers after the first call to dump/load.


Name mangling
=============

Name mangling is supported in datatypes with metadata (dataclass, attrs) by
having a 'name' key in the metadata.

@attr.s
class Example:
    attribute = attr.ib(type=int, metadata={'name': 'att.rib.ute:name'}

@dataclass
class Example():
  attribute: str = field(metadata={'name': 'att.rib.ute:name'})

The dictionary key for 'attribute' will be 'att.rib.ute:name'.

This is very useful for keys that use invalid or reserved characters that
can't be used in variable names.
Another common application is to convert camelCase into not_camel_case.

It is implemented this way to avoid doing automatic name translations,
that might introduce surprises.

To use a metadata key different than 'name', set the mangle_key parameter
to the loader/dumper.
